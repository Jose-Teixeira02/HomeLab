# HomeLab
This repository contains updates related to my HomeLab project :)

I decided to start this project as a way to expand my knowledge on the cybersecurity field, as well as, to get some hands-on experience with some of the core tools such as, SIEMs, AD, VPNs and Firewalls.

I believe configurating these tools on my own (of course with the help of some tutorials and ChatGPT) will be a great way to deepen my understanding of how they work and how they can be integrated into different environments.

I will document as I learn step by step. Why? Not only will I be able to come back and see the mistakes and improvements made along the way, I want to encourage and help people who are just starting out their own journey on this field. 


Stay tuned for more updates on my progress, lessons learned, and future plans!
